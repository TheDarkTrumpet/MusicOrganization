/*
   The purpose of this file is to clean up the .m4p files I have in a folder, recursively.
   Apple's iTunes has a weird directory structure that consists of AlbumArtist/Album
   But M4P files are unable to be run on anything but iTunes, unless you break the DRM.
   Apple, though, allows for upgrading one's library (iTunes Matching - $25.00 a year).
   While annoying to have to pay, it's better than it used to be.  Needless to say, since I can pull
   everything directly from iTunes again, deleting this is perfectly okay.
